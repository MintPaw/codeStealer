# CodeStealer
A Steam/Origin key stealing program using tesseract
Usage is simple, run "python3 steal.py --url myImage"
An example being:
python3 steal.py --url https://i.imgur.com/GqvByp6.png

Is it perfect? No, inf act it only work about 20% of the time in my testing.

But the point is I build this in the afternoon.
There are numerous sources explaining how to train and improve tesseract image recognition.
With a little bit of time and font traning with example keys (http://pastebin.com/1PhUrUXN and http://pastebin.com/zJzCuC8C) it could be perfect.

Don't post text keys in images, captcha-ify them.
